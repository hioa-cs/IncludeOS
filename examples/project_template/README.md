## Template files for new IncludeOS projects

This folder is a base folder you can use for new IncludeOS projects.
It contains three files: 

* new.sh
Use this file to initialize the files for your new project. Simply
run: ./new.sh my_project
This command will modify Makefile and run.sh as well as create a
ready-to-compile file my_project.cpp with "Hello World!" code. 

* Makefile
The Makefile will be modified with the new name of the project. When
running the make command, you'll end up with a bootable IncludeOS
image with the same name of your project, like "my_project.img" in the
case above.

* run.sh
Use this file to boot your image. It will get the name of the image
automatically from the ./new.sh script.

## Quick start

(Assuming you have installed IncludeOS earlier)

   cp -r IncludeOS/examples/project_template ~/my_project
   cd ~/my_project
   ./new.sh my_project
   make
   ./run.sh
   [ ctrl+a x ] to exit VM
